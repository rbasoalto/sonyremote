# Sony IR Remote for MSP430G* #

An experimental remote control based on MSP430G2211, an IR LED, and a 4x4 matrix keypad.

The keypad code is very suboptimal, I reused to some extent [my previous keypad project](https://github.com/rbasoalto/kptest).

Keypad should be connected to Port 1 (4 columns first, then 4 rows). IR LED to P2.6 or P2.7 (no crystal is needed, we can use those pins).

This remote, with light use, should get you many years of battery life on a CR2032 or similar coin cell.
